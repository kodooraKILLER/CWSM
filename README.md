# Chennai-Water-Supply-Manager

### Introduction to Innovative Projects submission
##### Team h20.ai

###Development history:
* v0: CWSM - Backpropagation Neural Nets
* v1: CWSM_indu - BPN with rectified nets for each reservoir
* v4: crabs - Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Nets (the breakthrough model)
* v5: DhanVan4 - LSTM with rectified performance (stable)
* v6: Elango-Esakki - Deep Reinforcement Learning using Actor-Critic algorithm
* v7: Kanmani - Embedded LSTM-CNN neural net


*NOTE: since we were able to obtain only a temporary url for free, we will deploy our website for 1-hour intervals*
### DEPLOYED WEBSITE LINK:
